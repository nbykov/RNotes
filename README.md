# Random R Notes

This repository contains a bunch of random R notes and scripts.

**scoping_and_assignment.R** - an explanation of <<- operator in R and a demonstration
of scoping rules and what the hierarchy of environments looks like, especially for
writing functions. This file is ready for sourcing and will source six functions.

**my_defaults.R** - So I don't lose my defaults for R :)

**rainfall.R** - Rainfall problem
